Project Overview

This project focuses on emotion recognition through textual data using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to classify text into predefined emotion categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. The project combines traditional machine learning algorithms and an LSTM-based deep learning model to achieve robust performance.

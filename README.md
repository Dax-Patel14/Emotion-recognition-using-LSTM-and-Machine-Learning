Project Overview

This project focuses on emotion recognition through textual data using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to classify text into predefined emotion categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. The project combines traditional machine learning algorithms and an LSTM-based deep learning model to achieve robust performance.

Features

Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization
Lowercasing
Stopword Removal
Stemming
Lemmatization
Text-to-Number Vectorization (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, TF-IDF, Word2Vec)

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

Deep Learning Model:

LSTM-based architecture for sequence modeling and emotion classification.

Dataset Handling:

Input textual data is preprocessed and transformed into padded sequences for the LSTM model.
